    <h2>Bhaal Cultists</h2>
    <p>A group worshipping Bhaal, God of Death. Their current objectives aren't quite clear as of now, but they seem to have picked a bad bone with the party. The party managed to survive their ambush in the Earldom of Darenby woods. Kenwyn convinced a young Bhaalist initiate named Dareon to change his ways of life. They also found out that their caravan master - Neral Falcin - had made a deal with Bhaal cultists to have the party as some sort of sacrifice for the God of Death. He was to claim his reward in Baldur's Street House 11 in Plodence. Later on, after leaving Kaxton, party got attacked by Bhaal Knight, who had a letter on him stating that Conriek and Charming were wanted dead by Bhaal cultists. There was an order given to specifically leave Wigganol alive. It also stated that Dareon got tortured. They seem to surely be aware of party's plans to visit Baldur's Street 11th House.
    <h2>The Barons</h2>
    <p>A powerful underground crime organization who has varying degree of control in the central large river cities of Dasan - Ludgo, Elemrun, Mattdon, Joxiburg. They're not the ones to shy away from making deals that the Kingdom might deem unlawful, but so far due to their sheer influence or slyness they managed to withstand the King's loyalist pressure and in some cities - Ludgo and especially Elemrun - they became the main rulling force of the cities, even overshadowing the King's loyalists. Yet with that being said, in face of a greater danger, it seems that they'd side with the Kingdom, rather than it's enemies. 
    <p>Their main base, where the leader of the Barons Raj Das usually resides, is Elemrun. Party found out that Charming once belonged to the Barons but for what reasons and why he left aren't quite clear as of yet. Baasha was also a part of the Barons, later on got demoted towards drinking his sorrows away alone in lighthouse close to Ludgo, in which he had to oversee incoming ships which had made shady dealings with the Barons and direct them where to deliver their contraband. The Barons are currently in the power struggle with Shuziomanians over Ludgo city.
    <h2>Confederation of Redwood Forest</h2>
    <p>A confederation of goliath, orc, firbolg and bugbear tribes that resides in the Redwood Forest. Over the centuries they got pushed deeper and deeper into the forest - even though the settlements closeby the forests, such as Darrenfall, Timbermore and Ormskirk were built by the tribes. Due to this injustice the tribals held a grudge against the the "civilized" Dasan citizens, especially the high elves of the easternmost earldoms, who would constantly harrass the tribals. Eventually, encouraged by the party, they would take back Darrenfall. For what is next to come is to be seen. Although it is worth mentioning that not all tribals are happy with Zhaq Elf-Axe's new party friends - Thrain Thunderpeak and his band of 100 goliaths have shown their dissaproval of them and left the tribe to join their kin serving in the Duchy of Nouran called Pact of Titans.
    <h2>Damned Knives</h2>
    <p>A slaver faction, whose influence seems to range across entire continent and further. They have 5 sectors in Dasan: Appleby, Blackburn, Silverkeep, Berxley and their main base - Froison. Kenwyn seems to have a past history with this faction and is after them. Their main leader is Vulmar Leonieth. The party has found out that Damned Knives and the Barons have become allied in the carnival that was held next to Middlestead Lake. They also denied their ambitions of acquiring Darrenfall as the sixth sector, by informing and preventing tribals and Saviours of the Pure from massacring each other for now. The party also recently annihilated entire Berxley sector by burning all of their members inside a barn. 
    <h2>Saviours of the Pure</h2>
    <p>Faction focused on ensuring elvish dominance in the eastern realms. Their main base being located in Fort Pure, south of Darrenfall. Although they had support in Darrenfall and to lesser extent in Timbermore it appears that any chance they had of being an influential force in Duchy of Plodemire is in the past, since most of their support has dwindled down after the party exposed their malevolent schemes trying to spread hatred across towns. Their main leader Elyon Gretoris resides in Fort Pure with about 500 of them - seemingly all that's left of these "vigilantes".
    <h2>Iron Hearth Coalition</h2>
    <p>Mostly humans, who have fled to rural region nort of Joxiburg to establish an independent communities from the Dukes, Earls, Towns or Factions - such as Damned Knives or the Barons. Only ruler that they acknowledge is the king of Dasan - Barnet IV Mafedor. Being so pro-independence, they especially despise any sort of corruption which makes them natural enemies with shady factions such the Barons. Charming and the party has recently befriended Iron Hearth Coalition elder Aldric, by exposing Weanah the Tailor, who was smuggling Slumbervine - a very sought after herb that can put almost any creature to sleep. 
    <h2>Pacts of Titans</h2>
    <p>A goliath mercenary band that has been serving wood elf duke of Nouran for centuries, since he was the only one to see the benefit in the goliath strength rather than feuding with them like the high elves of Duchy of Plodemire. It is said that many of the strongest goliaths head down south once they're deemed worthy to join this mercenary band and consider it a great honour. Thrain Thunderpeak and his band of 100 goliaths was last seen headed down there.
    <h2>Shuziomanians</h2>
    <p>People representing the Shuziomanian Sultanate, which is located in the very south of the continent that Dasan is located in. They're in control of most of the inland and especially sea trade. Only ones to rival them might be Ambarano Merchant Republic, but since they're far away from this continent, the Shuziomanians are pretty much unchallenged as the merchants of Dasan. Kenwyn used to complete trades with Shuziomania for most of his life. Shuziomanians seem to be up to shady schemes in Dasan, trying to increase their not only economic, but also political influence in the region. Kenwyn and Wigganol uncovered that they seem to have made some sort of deal with Antasden.  
    <h2>Dasan Kingdom Loyalists</h2>
    <p>Pretty much any officer that is appointed by the king in the earldoms/duchies that see the support for a united Dasan Kingdom on the decline. Be it due to the dwarvish war or Shuziomanian or Barons actions. There seems to be some sort of agency created to help these loyalists and anyone pro-Kingdom. Wigganol seems to be linked to it somehow.
    <h2>Kingdom of Ester (dwarves)</h2>
    <p>Dwarves from the neighboring Kingdom of Ester, had enough of elvish disrespect, who kept harrassing the dwarvish immigrants in Duchy of Couran and finally decided to invade, after which part had to flee Crouver. They were contacting with dissidents in Dasan by using raven messengers but that was exposed by the party. Their main general is Hozzumlin Mountainbane and their queen is Luzhunda II. 
    <p>They recently defeated Kingdom of Dasan forces close to Vegspear town, after which elvish army was forced to flee back to Plodence.
    <h2>Lost Legacy Seekers</h2>
    <p>Relic hunter group, who sells very sought after artifacts. Conriek has killed their main leader in Crouver before the chaos ensued. Now the group is in a power struggle between Enania and Myron who formed their cliques. Enania has recruited Kenwyn and Conriek to find her the Ancient Crown of Mafedors, meanwhile Myron is after Scion of the Skies nearby Moonmoor Mountains (which is one of the three needed components for forging Talos Skyshatterer, other two being Crimson Tear and Eye of the Tempest that Conriek already posseses). Enania expressed that she wouldn't mind seeing Myron die if needed.
    <h2>Eldertome Wardens</h2>
    <p>A sort of monastic-type order dedicated to storing very important artifacts, transcripts or documents and secure them from general public or harmful sources. They try to maintain complete neutrality unless their headquarters in danger. Their headquarters, which aren't far away from Nouver are locked away from any outsiders. Enania told the party that they might find a secret map which would show a location of Harmony Embrace Sanctum, which is rumoured to have Ancient Crown of Mafedors inside of it.
    <h2>Drow Vigilantes</h2>
    <p>Lead by Akseni these vigilantes fight for integrity, equality for drows inside the Plodence. They are trying to make high elves see the value of fully integrated drows in the city and other stigmas associated with em.
    <h2>Grafted Eyes</h2>
    <p>A mercenary band lead by Grisht. They have been hired by the duke of Plodence to patrol the streets, since his own guards are constantly patrolling outskirts and the walls of Plodence due to imminent danger from the dwarves.</body>
