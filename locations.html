    Darrenfall
    </h2>
    <b>Description & Lore:</b> A small town located in subarctic climate. Used to be originally inhabited by the tribals from Redwood Forest, but got pushed out of this area by high elf colonizers. Due to party’s involvement, the town is back to being ruled by the tribals, some of whom are starting to adopt a more civilized ways of life, like the high elves who lived here before them.

    Timbermore
    </h2>
    <b>Description & Lore:</b> Average sized town located in tundra climate. The town was originally settled in the middle of a forest and inhabited by the tribals. However, the high elves pushed them out of the surrounding areas and deforested the area around the city. As the name suggests, the city’s main export is timber, of which it still has plethora of due to Redwood Forest being massive. Due to many closeby areas needing timber for various projects, the town is quite prosperous and keeps close connections to the nearby towns, especially Ludgo, whose ports it uses to export timber overseas. The population of the town, unlike neighboring Darrenfall, is more openminded in comparison. A potential uprising by the discontent tavern patrons (funded by dwarves) was prevented by Wigganol and Kenwyn.

    <h2>
    Kaxton
    </h2>
    <b>Description & Lore:</b> A small town, located in the crossroads between many larger and more important cities. The town used to be a place for Talos worshippers to live in, but worship of this deity became forbidden across Dasan few centuries ago so they had to abandon their old religious ways. Town’s council decided to build a temple of Illmater instead, but by cutting corners and saving few coins, they only changed few symbolisms from Talos to Illmater, leaving the Crypt below and the following statues to still represent the town’s religious past. Recently the temple has collapsed due to Conriek’s scheming ways and a big trial was held against him in the town.

    Ludgo
    </h2>
    <b>Description & Lore:</b> A large port city, used for imports and exports from the overseas regions by the eastern part of Dasan, due to Crouver being occupied by the dwarves nowadays. There’s a three-way battle for power and influence inside the city between the Shuziomanians, the Barons and the Earl’s loyalists. Unfortunately, not much else is known about the city since party has only taken a brief visit inside this city and there’s more to be discovered.

    Ormskirk
    </h2>
    <b>Description & Lore:</b> A small town, which, same as most of the other towns nearby Redwood Forest used to be inhabited by the tribals. However, unlike complete indigenous town residents exile like in the high elves’ towns, inside this one the humans and the orcs intermarried and most of the town residents in here nowadays are half-orcs. So, this town and its council usually acts as sort of mediators between the two sides in case of conflict. The town itself has few mystical buildings left by the Sylvanus worshipping tribals. Very close to the town, there’s also a monastery of Lathander.

    <h2>
    Plodence
    </h2>
    <b>Description & Lore:</b> One of the three largest cities in Dasan. The city was originally settled by drows, therefore especially in the underdark it is possible to find many Lolth-related structures. Overtime High Elf migrants from the Eastern Dasan became the majority in the city and started slowly pushing the drows more and more into the underdark ghettos which became more and more lawless due to becoming overcrowded. The tensions between the high elves and the drows are currently very high, and there’s distrust between the two sides, some high elves thinking drows might betray them and side with the invading dwarves. Inside both Underdark and less patrolled outskirt areas, there’s a lot of illegal activities going on.

    <h2>
    Iron Hearth Coalition
    </h2>
    <b>Description & Lore:</b> An isolationist confederation made up by human settlers, who didn’t want to acknowledge local high elf authority. They only bow down to the King of Dasan and no one else. These people value personal independence very highly and are very focused on protecting it from outsiders. Due to the Barons faction having a lot of influence in the town of Joxiburg across the river, they tend to get involved in various conflicts with them quite often. Iron Hearth Coalition lands are also built on top of magical soil in which a plant named Slumbervine can grow – which is sought after by many traders across the world.
